## Are you looking for a job?

Are you tired of having to create a flawed CV by trying to transcribe all your professional skills through a few lines and a photo?
Use JobScoring!
JobScoring puts an end to the difficulty of creating a CV that never really highlights all our potential, with our application you can directly enter all your skills, your professional liabilities (your studies, your internships, your former jobs) and our algorithm will give you a score. 

- This score will be stored on our database and when a recruiter looks for someone for a job he will know that you are the right one! Indeed, the main interest of the application lies in the fact that the link between the job seeker and the recruiter is direct and anonymous. The recruiter will enter all the skills he is looking for and then JobScoring will display the 10 best profiles selected simply because of the score assigned to the job seeker. This direct path between the 2 interlocutors makes it possible to increase the speed of recruitment by directly selecting the best profiles for the position. 
- Our system is based on that of dating sites, once the profile sought by the employer coincides with one or more profiles present on our database then there will be a "match" following which the 2 people can agree or not to continue the process. Once the match has been accepted, a chat will open so that a pre-employment phase can begin.
